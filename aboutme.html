        <h1 id="heading">Football Scout</h1>
        <p id="para">My name is Nick Onley. Iâ€™m a 26-year-old football fanatic from Manchester. My dream is to build a huge database with young talents that are not so well known football players from all around the world. This will be the aim of this site. Orignaly a rugby fan but since moving up to manchester it became very apparent very quickly that i had to pick a team, yes you may have guessed i am now a Manchester United fan, but i am first and formost a football fan, with a major interest in analytics and AI. the aim is not only to have a major portfolio of players but also to eventually with updates create a database for requested matches that can be replayed and clipped whilst data will also be able to be sourced from said clips using AI analysis. 

            I encourage You to comment, ask questions and report about talented footballers from Your countries. </p>
